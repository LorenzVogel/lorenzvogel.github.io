This is a list of my peer-reviewed and preprint publications in reverse-chronological order. All authors are listed alphabetically, following the convention in high-energy physics (HEP). Exceptions occur for medical papers. You can also find my publications on INSPIRE-HEP (particle-physics papers) and Google Scholar (all papers).

The medical papers originate from my work as a research assistant at the Department of Prosthetic Dentistry of the Heidelberg University Hospital during my physics studies.
